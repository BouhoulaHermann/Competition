specification SEQ

sorts

	nat seq

constructors

	0: -> nat
	s: nat -> nat
	Empty: -> seq
	Seq: nat seq -> seq
	

defined functions

	conc: seq seq -> seq

axioms

	conc(Empty, ys) = ys;

	reverse(Seq(x, xs)) = conc(reverse(xs), Seq(x, Empty));

conjectures

	conc(xs, Empty) = xs;
	conc(conc(xs, ys), zs) = conc(xs, conc(ys, zs));
	reverse(conc(xs, ys)) = conc(reverse(ys), reverse(xs));
	reverse(reverse(xs)) = xs;
