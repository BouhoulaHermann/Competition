+++ Rewrite System

+++ inductive positions:
... for rotate: 0
+++ maximal depths of left-hand sides:
... for rotate: 2
+++ general maximal depth = 2
+++ sort dependence: nat < tree
+++ test sets for defined functions and sorts:
... for rotate

+++ conjecture(s)
	rotate(rotate(x)) = x

+++ inference system initiated
+++ treating clause
	rotate(rotate(x)) = x
+++ inductive narrowing on conjecture
	rotate(rotate(x)) = x

+++ creating new conjecture

+++ creating new conjecture
	rotate(rotate(node(xts, yts, zts))) = node(xts, yts, zts)
--- clause
	rotate(rotate(leaf)) = leaf
... reduced to tautology
	leaf = leaf
--- clause
	rotate(rotate(node(xts, yts, zts))) = node(xts, yts, zts)
... reduced in 2 steps to
	node(rotate(rotate(xts)), yts, rotate(rotate(zts))) = node(xts, yts, zts)
... decomposed into new clause(s)
	rotate(rotate(xts)) = xts
	rotate(rotate(zts)) = zts
+++ inductive narrowing succeeded
--- clause
	rotate(rotate(x)) = x

	rotate(rotate(x)) -> x
+++ added new clause(s)
