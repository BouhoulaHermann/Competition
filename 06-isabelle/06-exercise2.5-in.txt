specification SumOfN

sorts nat

constructors

	0: -> nat
	s: nat -> nat

defined functions

	+: nat nat -> nat
	*: nat nat -> nat
	sum:  nat -> nat

precedence

	sum > * > + > s > 0

axioms

	x + 0 = x;
	x + s(y) = s(x + y);
	s(x) + y = s(x + y);
	
	0 * x = 0;
	s(x) * y = (x * y) + y;
	
	sum(0) = 0;
	sum(s(x)) = s(x) + sum(x);

conjectures

	 s(s(0)) * sum(x) = x * s(x);
